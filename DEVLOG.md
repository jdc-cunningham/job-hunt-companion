So I don't have this fully designed in my mind.

I definitely want a database since I want that to persist better, be accessible by other things means need an API

I did this solar chan project and also this crypto desktop alert thing in the past, I'll combine those as mechanisms for this thing

It's a bit of work and after work I can't really code but all of this is trivial/stuff I've already done before

Pretty much I just want something that bugs me on my desktop and tells me to apply

I also want to track jobs I looked at but didn't apply to because not qualified

I have an extra day off next week so I have time to work on this but will def apply to something.

job db schema

id, company, job_info, tech stack, applied_date, status, last_updated
